                        <p>The ABC Library plays a vital role in connecting students, faculty, and scholars across the academy with information, ideas, and each other. While we continue to support traditional modes of scholarship through our print collections, primary source material, and research consultations, we increasingly support emerging trends in learning and scholarship, such as digital information formats, multimedia production, data set utilization and management, and sustaining key partnerships to better enable student success.</p><br>

                        <p>We developed the Research Commons initiative with our partners across campus to connect students with research assistance at the point of need. Students can now receive on-site training on statistical software and in-depth consultations on statistical methodology for their research projects, in-person writing assistance, research consultations with librarians who are experts in the disciplines, on-site tech help, and access to the scholarly resources needed for in-depth research.</p>
