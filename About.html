        <h2>CORE FUNCTIONS</h2>
        <p>These includes:-
            - promote, establish, equip, manage and maintain the National and Public libraries services in Kenya<br>
            -promote information literacy and reading among Kenyans<br>
            -enhance stakeholders participation for equitable development of libraries throughout the country<br>
            -Advise the Government, local authorities and other public bodies on all matters relating to library,<br>
            documentation and related
            services.</p>

        <h2>ORGANIZATION STRACTURE</h2>
        <p>An appropriate organization structure has been developed to <br>enhance management, leadership and support of
            this strategic plan.<br> The necessary responsibility and authority relationship structures have been put
            down as depicted in the organization chart.
            However, an organization restructuring, job evaluation and review may become necessary in the near future in
            order for knls to <br>be up to its task in contributing to Vision 2030. These exercises will need to
            establish the composition of the Board, staff levels and re-examine job specifications and descriptions that
            exist.

        <h2>ROLES OF THIS LIBRARY IN THE COMMUNITY</h2>
        <p>Provision of information for development through the national and public library network enables people to
            fight poverty deprivation <br>and illiteracy and thus supports reading and recovery programmes by the
            government. Rural and urban poor communities are better able to tackle their problems<br> and introduce
            social change if they have access to relevant <br>information that meets their needs and interests.
            In addition, access to information about the country enables citizens to participate effectively in the art
            of governance.

            Through various reading campaigns, ABC library service provides opportunities for communities <br>to enhance their reading and
            information seeking habits,<br> and therefore sustain literacy. The 2020 Kenya National Adult Literacy
            Survey estimated the national<br> literacy rate at 61.5 % indicating that only 38.5 % Kenyan adults were
            illiterate.
            The survey also revealed that only 29.6 % of the adult population had acquired <br>the desired mastery level of
            literacy.<br> This meant that the majority of those termed as literate (61.5 %) were at risk of losing their
            literacy skills or could not effectively perform<br> within the context of knowledge economies.

            However, a country with effective library and information services will achieved <br>any better than ensuring
            that library services are accessible to as many Kenyans as possible throughout the country.
            Public libraries go beyond formal education and <br>they are at the heart of personal and community development.
                ABC library service promotes reading by providing access<br> to relevant reading materials to all communities. Libraries
            play a major role in stimulating <br>public interest in books and in promoting reading for knowledge,<br>
            information and enjoyment – thus ABC library service is indeed a “people’s knowledge source.”
